Hash Password Service

Command to run the jar of part 1 in cmd: java -jar passwordservice.jar

I made test data to test the validation method in the PasswordServiceImpl in part 1 and forgot to take it off and submitted it with this data.
So, in part 2 the login was always true as the client input data were never use.
I rectified the problem later and update the PasswordServiceImpl class and resubmitted my part 1 jar file along with part 2.
